Reflection

The data is structured because it contains organized data in a table, with clear rows and columns. Each column represents a specific field such as date, amount, payment method, category and description , while each row represents a specific transaction. This allows for easy analysis and manipulation of the data.
I faced challenges in ensuring the right amount of formatting, ensuring accurate data and ensuring consistency in my categorization. I also had to remember every transaction I made during the week accurately. 
A structured dataset like this can be used for budgeting apps, that is to track expenses over a period of time and study trends in spending. It can also in expense forecasting to predict future expenses and make informed financial decisions.
I learned that structure is very important in data science because it enables efficient analysis and modeling of data. Without structure, data would be difficult to work with and it would be difficult to analyze data and make meaningful analysis from it .Therefore, this dataset has taught me the importance of careful data collection, planning and formatting.
Also, by tracking my expenses I gained valuable insights about my weekly spending and the application of data structure in real world applications.
