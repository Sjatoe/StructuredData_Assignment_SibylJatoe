Personal Expense Structure

This dataset represents my personal expenditure over one week. It is a structured dataset with 5 columns : date, category, amount, payment method and description. This dataset is structured because it has organized and formatted data in a table , wit clear columns and rows. Each row represents a single transaction while each column represents a specific field. Some insights I gained from my dataset is that I Spend most of my money on food and my most used method of payment was cash.
